    <h1>Croissant 🥐</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky French pastry, made from puff pastry. The
      dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded a few times, then rolled
      into it's shape. Known for its crescent shape it was named crescent in
      French, croissant. The birth of this pastry started from an adaptation of
      a kipferl, a Viennese morning sweet, slightly denser and packed with fruit
      and nut filling. The pastry made its debut in Paris when a Viennese baker
      opened his patisserie in 1838.
